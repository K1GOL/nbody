Simple n-body gravity simulation. Not particularly accurate, useful, or beautiful for that matter, just something fun to look at.

Default scenario is Jupiter and the Galielan moons with a spacecraft.

Value inputs support scientific notation (for example `4.5e6` will become `4500000`).

In addition, you can use the following strings to automatically substitute their appropriate values into inputs when creating a new body:

`minute, hour, day, kilometer, earthRadius, moonRadius, jupiterRadius, sunRadius, astronomicalUnit, moonMass, earthMass, jupiterMass, sunMass`
